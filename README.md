# explic.AI (EXPLainable and Interpretable Constructs for Artificial Intelligence)

*explic.AI* is a research project aimed at enhancing the transparency and interpretability of artificial intelligence systems. The project focuses on developing novel techniques and methodologies to make AI decision-making processes more understandable to humans. Key objectives include:

- Designing human-readable explanations for AI outputs
- Developing visualization tools for complex AI decision pathways
- Investigating the ethical implications of explainable AI

By improving the explainability of AI systems, explic.AI aims to increase trust, accountability, and adoption of AI technologies across various domains, ensuring that they can be reliably used in critical applications where understanding the reasoning behind AI-driven outcomes is essential.
