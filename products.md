## LLM-MRI - A brain scanner for LLMs

The main end-user product developed by the explic.AI project is currently the LLM-MRI python library. The library allows the creation of visual and mathematical artifacts that represent the activation patterns elicited by a set of documents presented to a LLM. These artifacts can help users understand how the knowledge embedded in the documents is represented.
