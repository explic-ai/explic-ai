## LLM-MRI - A brain scanner for LLMs

The main end-user product developed by the explic.AI project is currently the LLM-MRI python library. The library allows the creation of visual and mathematical artifacts that represent the activation patterns elicited by a set of documents presented to a LLM. These artifacts can help users understand how the knowledge embedded in the documents is represented.

## Python-OAM - OAM toolbox made by the community for the community

explic.AI also created the Python-OAM library, which allows users to easily apply Outlier Aspect Mining algorithms to improve the explainability of Outlier Detection algorithms.

## Lda Over Time 

LdaOverTime is a framework that brings an easier way of doing Topic Modeling Analysis Over Time and get visualization of results.

In brief, Topic Modeling is a technique that finds topics that each document from a collection covers. And, by addind the time in this equation, we can study how much and why one certain topic is more or less discussed in a time slice.
